\section{Read me}

This assignment should compile and run on any reasonably POSIX compliant
environment. The assignment was tested and debugged using \texttt{gdb}, then
checked for memory leaks and invalid accesses using \texttt{valgrind} on the
following platforms:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{neptune.azabani.com} ---
	      Cygwin x86-64,
	      \texttt{gcc} 4.8.2,
	      GNU \texttt{make} 4.0
	\item \texttt{ark.cs.curtin.edu.au} ---
	      Linux 2.6.19 x86-32,
	      \texttt{gcc} 4.0.2,
	      GNU \texttt{make} 3.80
	\item \texttt{ling.comssa.org.au} ---
	      Linux 3.2.0 x86-64,
	      \texttt{gcc} 4.7.2,
	      GNU \texttt{make} 3.81
	\item \texttt{ling.comssa.org.au} ---
	      Linux 3.2.0 x86-64,
	      \texttt{clang} 3.0,
	      NetBSD \texttt{pmake} 1.111
\end{itemize}

Instructions for compilation and execution:

\begin{itemize}
	\item To compile all binaries and the report, type \texttt{make}
	\item To compile only the binaries, type \texttt{make binaries}
	\item To compile only the report, type \texttt{make report.pdf}
	\item To delete all generated files, type \texttt{make clean}
	\item To run the standalone RR simulator, type \texttt{./robin}
	\item To run the standalone SJF simulator, type \texttt{./sjf}
	\item To run the threaded simulator, type \texttt{./simulator}
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions made}

The input file is assumed to conform to the expected format as outlined in the
assignment specification. Scarce checking is done other than ensuring that the
file exists, is readable, and has at least one job entry.

The file format for input to the Shortest Job First scheduler shall be the same
as for the Round Robin scheduler, that is, the first line contains a quantum
value. The quantum value is simply ignored by the SJF scheduler, much like
priorities would be ignored if they were included in a SJF or FCFS scheduler.

Where multiple jobs arrive at the Round Robin scheduler simultaneously, they
are queued in the same order as they appear in the input file. The jobs are not
further sorted by duration, for example.
